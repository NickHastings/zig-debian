Description: Imperative, general-purpose, statically typed, system programming language
 The ultimate goal of the Zig project is to serve users. As a
 first-order effect, this means users of the compiler, helping
 programmers to write better software. Even more important, however,
 are the end-users. Zig is intended to be used to help end-users
 accomplish their goals. Zig should be used to empower end-users,
 never to exploit them financially, or to limit their freedom to
 interact with hardware or software in any way.
 .
 This package provides the zig compiler.
